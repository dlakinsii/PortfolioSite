	<p> Welcome to my website. This page started out as mere html/css sidebar practice, but I decided to make a full website out of it. Please make yourself at home and navigate around the site as you wish. I have removed the original repeating page text. There is sufficient text on my Skills page to demonstrate scrolling.</p>
	
	<p>This site is undergoing a re-design and will re-launch in August, 2018.</p>
