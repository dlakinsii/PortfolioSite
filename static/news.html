	<p>Coming Soon:  Hero Banner</p>
	<p>Since removing the sidebar navigation, this site looks pretty plain. I will be adding a Hero Banner to the front page and probably image headers to the other pages. I might do something with parallax scrolling as well, but probably not. tl;dr: aesthetic improvements inbound!</p>
	<strong> June 20, 2018</strong>
	<p>Based on advice from our lead designer, I have removed the side navigation.</p>
	<strong> June 18, 2018</strong>
	<p>I have created a C# console application that takes ip addresses as command line arguments and compares them to app.forestry.io/ips.text. Any argument strings not found on the forestry list display a warning with the offending ip, and any on the Forestry list not provided as an argument display a different warning along with the offending ip. If all goes well it exits with a status code of 0 and a successful validation message. Otherwise, it exits with a status code of 1. </p>
	<p>My original implementation only took one argument and either said it was valid or it was not. I had incorrectly assumed that the app would be called separately for each ip address. This way was a bit trickier, but I'm happier with the end result. I also moved the url string from main() to ConfigurationManager.AppSettings. Eventually this job will run every morning. </p>

	<p> I have created this website to sharpen my html and css skills in anticipation of rebuilding one of our websites over the summer at my internship </p>
