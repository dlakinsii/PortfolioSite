	<strong>ASP.NET/C#/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery</strong>
	<p>For my senior project, I worked with two others to develop an MVC based Client and Donor Management System for a Jacksonville, FL based non-profit focused on helping students with disabilities. I'm also involved with several MVC and Web Forms projects at my internship.</p>
	
	<br>
	<strong>Hugo/Forestry/HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery/Go/TOML/YAML/JSON</strong>
	<p>The company I work for is in the process of migrating several of our websites from a dated version of Sitecore to Forestry. We are rebuilding our ASP.NET solutions as static sites with Hugo. I'm researching static site search solutions including Lunr.js, ElasticSearch, ElasticLunr, Fuse.js, and Google Custom Search.<p>
	<br>
	<strong>PHP</strong>
	<p>PHP is a "bad word" where I work, so my experience so far is limited what I learned in Internet Programming. For my group project we built a site similar to imdb.com for games rather than movies. Obviously it was much smaller than imdb.com, but we did win the student choice award for best site.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>C</strong>
	<p>I have written C programs for several classes including Computer Science I and Data Structures</p>
	<br>
	<strong>C++</strong>
	<p>I learned C++ in High School when I took Programming II, and in college when I took COP 1000<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Java</strong>
	<p> I have used Java in several classes including Introduction to Java, Object Oriented Programming, Computer Science II, and Data Structures. </p>
	<br>
	<strong>VB.NET</strong>
	<p> I first learned Visual Basic in High School in my Programming I class. I have used VB.NET in Object Oriented Programming and Web Systems Development</p>
	
	<strong>SQL</strong>
	<p>One of my tasks as an intern was to create a "Get Users By Group (number)" page for one of our ASP.NET Web Forms applications. The page consisted of a Text Area for inserting comma separated group numbers and a Telerik RadGrid for displaying results, as well as Submit and Clear buttons. The input had to be heavily sanitized with Regular Expressions before querying our SQL Database with those group numbers and displaying the results. I have also used SQL in Web Systems Development and Database Systems classes. I have used MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>Agile Development</strong>
	<p>We use an Agile development process where I work with daily and weekly SCRUMS and Kanban (Target Process) tracking of user stories.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>Rational Unified Process (RUP)</strong>
	<p>For my senior project we used a combination of RUP documentation and Agile Development. I helped create our Software Development Plan, and created many more documents including use cases, ER Diagrams, UML Diagrams, Activity Diagrams. We tracked our stories on JIRA.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>BASIC</strong>
	<p>This was my first programming language. From the ages of 6-15 I wrote many programs in BASICA, GWBASIC, and later QBASIC. I also played around with DARK BASIC briefly.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>Microsoft SharePoint 2010<strong>
	<p>At my job we use SharePoint 2010 for some of our internal sites, and I rebuilt our Product Information Center as one of my first projects.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>Sitecore</strong>
	<p>Many of our static sites use Sitecore 5 for Content Management. Stories involving content updates are typically assigned to dev interns, so I have gained a lot of experience with Sitecore.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>Version Control</strong>
	<p>I'm pretty comfortable with Git. We use it at work with BitBucket, and I have personal projects on GitHub. I'm very comfortable with Sourcetree, but lately I've been using git bash commands more and more. I'm also familiar with TortoiseGit, and Git Extensions.<p>
	<strong>Continuous Deployment<strong>
	<p>My company uses GoCD. I have also set up continuous delivery with Forestry and Netlify.</p>
	<br>
	<strong>Change Management<strong>
	<p>I'm experienced with creating CM tickets in Cherwell Service Management</p>
